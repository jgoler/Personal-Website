        Hi! I'm Jack, a senior at Menlo School from Menlo Park, California. I'm
        an avid coder and mathematician. I enjoy playing games ranging from
        Poker and Catan to pick up basketball and fast-paced ping pong. You can
        usually find me golfing (albeit poorly), solving Project Euler problems,
        brainstorming app ideas, puzzling over competition-based math problems,
        and coding random projects. Currently, my interests in Computer Science
        include machine learning and its medical applications, as well as
        cybersecurity and ethical hacking. My garage is my creative space. I
        converted it into a maker space to build my projects. While I'm just
        working on personal projects, it's cool to work in a space that reminds
        me of the HP, Apple, Google, and other Silicon Valley tech legendsâ€™
        origin stories. Speaking of tech legends, much like Steve Jobs, I have a
        limited wardrobe of eight nearly identical outfits, except I wear shorts
        and t-shirts instead of turtlenecks.
